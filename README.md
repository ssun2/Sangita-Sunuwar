I have always been fascinated by logical reasoning used to solve problems in coding and pixels lit up in response always excites me. I have worked in Learndirect online learning system as an administrator for 3 years. I admired the system and used to wonder and wish if I could do something like that. I have seen the web site improve and evolve delivering usersâ€™ needs and interest. Often times, the changes were the ones I wished it could be implemented there.
